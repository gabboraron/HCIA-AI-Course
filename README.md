# HCIA-AI-Course
> This course is jointly launched by Huawei and Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dalian University of Technology，matching the HCIA-AI V3.0（Released on September 17, 2020). Through this course, you will systematically understand the AI development history, the Huawei Ascend AI system, the full-stack all-scenario AI strategy，and the algorithms related to traditional machine learning and deep learning; TensorFlow and MindSpore. HCIA-AI V1.0 will be offline on June 30, 2021.

> **AI:** A new technical science that focuses on there search and development of theories, methods, techniques, and application systems for simulating and extending human intelligence
> 
> **Machine learning:** A core research field of AI. It focuses on the study of how computers cano btain new knowledge or skills by simulating or performing learning behavior of human beings, and reorganize existing knowledge architecture to improve its performance.
> 
> **Deep learning:** Deep learning aims to simulate the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and texts.

### Symbolism
- The cognitive process of human beings is the process of inference and operation of various symbols.
- Human being is a physical symbol system, and so is a computer.
- The core of AI lies in knowledge representation, knowledge inference, and knowledge application. Knowledge and concepts can be represented with symbols. Cognition is the process of symbol processing while inference refers to the process of solving problems by using heuristic knowledge and search.

### Connectionism
- The basis of thinking is neurons rather than the process of symbol processing
- Human brains vary from computers. A computer working mode based on connectionism is proposed to replace the computer working mode based on symbolic operation.

### Behaviorism
- Intelligence depends on perception and action.
- Intelligence requires no knowledge, representation, or inference. AI can evolve like human intelligence. Intelligent behavior can only be demonstrated in the real world through the constant interaction with the surrounding environment.

### Types of AI:
#### Strong AI
> Holds that it is possible to create intelligent machines that can really reason and solve problems. Such machines are considered to be conscious and self-aware, can independently think about problems and work out optimal solutions to problems, have their own system of values and world views, and have all the same instincts as living things,
#### Weak AI
> Holds that intelligent machines cannot really reason and solve problems. These machines only look intelligent, but do not have real intelligence.

### Huawei's Full-Stack, All-Scenario AI Portfolio
- **Application enablement:** provides end-to-end services (ModelArts), layered APIs, and pre-integrated solutions
- **MindSpore:** supports the unified training and inference framework that is independent of the device, edge, and cloud
    - provides automatic parallel capabilities. Can run a gorithms on dozens or even thousands of AI computing nodes with only a few lines of description.
- **CANN:** (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) a chip operator library and highly automated operator development tool.
    - A chip operators library and highly automated operator development toolkitOptimal development efficiency, in-depth optimization of the common operator library, and abundant APIs 
- **Ascend:** provides a series of NPU IPs and chips based on a unified, scalable architecture.
- **Atlas:** enables an all-scenario AI infrastructure solution that is oriented to the device, edge, and cloud based on the Ascend series AI processors and various product forms.

### Algorithmic Bias
Algorithmic biases are mainly caused by data biases.

### Tools
- Tensorflow2.0: TensorFlow 2.0 has been officially released. It integrates Keras as its high-level API, greatly improving usability.
